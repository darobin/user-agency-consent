      <p>
        Consent is increasingly seen as the primary basis upon which to process personal data, in
        much the same way that it was long considered to be an acceptable foundation atop which a
        security model could grant an application access to elevated privileges. It was by and large
        a dreadful approach to security, it is hardly any better for privacy.

      - style
      - agency > consent (for security, but also for privacy)
      - third-party cookies issue as a case (and mention GDPR violation as an open question, but
        with list of articles violatied)
      ## Outline
      * List WP29 guidelines, a race to increase criteria for consent that cannot be won. dark
        patterns will prevail.
      * Too much complexity
      * Too much fatigue
      * Everyone has to be an enforcer, which is too time-consuming and does not work
      * Toxic for individual privacy
      * Toxic for privacy overall
      * The importance of non-modality
      * Machine-readable provenance
        * What is the MVP?
        * How easily can we deploy simple systems that detail provenance?
        * How can they be turned into effective reports?
      * Unlikely security, privacy can lend itself more to asynchronous processing
        * With rights of erasure, privacy can (assuming no bad actors, which aren't the primary
          threat) be recuperated after the fact.
        * Strong declarative provenance can be audited
        * There can be user-level audits: what is the transitive tree of data sharing for a given
          system you interact with?
      * Transparency in personal data processing can be key and regulatorily enforced. People only
        need to care once in a while, and a small number of caring people can lead to enforcement
        for all. This is a vastly superior to the individualistic model behind consent.
      * This leads to a reÃ«nforcement of legitimate interest as a basis, given stronger transparency
      * Where to add:
        * The 3P cookie issue as a violation (try to mention it in there somewhere)
